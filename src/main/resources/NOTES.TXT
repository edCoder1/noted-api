Hi - thank you for those wonderful tutorials, regarding deployment and after watching a lot of Spring champions (Josh Long) they basically not use
anymore WAR, it is only JAR files, will you by any chance record a video for JAR deployment? thanks again

Hello and thank you for the encouragement. Deploying JAR files is pretty straight: java - jar yourapp.jar.
This is all there is to itðŸ˜Š Deploying war is a little more tedious, that's why I chose it for an episode.

@Romanian Coder Thank you for the clarification :), great work you have done there and waiting for the
Spring Boot Security coding videos to see how we can implement it as I will have to add security for my app.thanks again.
